# 🌿 THE GREEN ORACLE
## Smart Plant Disease Detection System (Client-Side AI)

### Overview
The Green Oracle is a real artificial intelligence web system that analyzes plant leaf images using a pre-trained convolutional neural network executed entirely in the browser.

### Key Innovation
- Real AI (CNN – MobileNet)
- No backend server
- No database
- No local model training
- Runs fully on GitHub Pages

### Technology Stack
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- TensorFlow.js
- MobileNet (Pre-trained CNN)
- GitHub Pages

### How It Works
1. User uploads a plant leaf image
2. Image is processed in the browser
3. A pre-trained CNN extracts visual features
4. The model returns classification predictions with confidence scores

### Why This Is Real AI
The system uses a deep convolutional neural network trained by experts on millions of images. The model is reused for inference, which is a standard professional AI practice.

### Limitations
- The model is general-purpose and not trained exclusively on plant diseases
- Accuracy may vary depending on image quality

### Future Improvements
- Plant-specific transfer learning
- Disease-specific labels
- Multilingual explanations
- Cloud ML integration

### Deployment
This project is deployed using GitHub Pages and requires no server-side infrastructure.
